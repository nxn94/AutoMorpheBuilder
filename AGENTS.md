# AGENTS.md — AutoMorpheBuilder

AutoMorpheBuilder is a GitHub Actions pipeline that builds signed, patched Android APKs with [Morphe](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches) patches. **The workflow is the product** — there is no app to run locally. This file is a guide for AI agents and human contributors working in the repo.

## Sources of Truth

Every authoritative file in the repo, with its role. When information conflicts, the file listed below wins; this document only summarises them.

- `config.json` — application definitions and patch repositories.
- `patches.json` — per-application patch selection (repo-keyed format, see `docs/configuration.md`).
- `.github/workflows/morphe-build.yml` — main build orchestration (daily + `workflow_dispatch`).
- `.github/workflows/update-patches.yml` — patch metadata updates from upstream patch repos.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — continuous integration (PR + main gate).
- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` — security analysis.
- Workflow performance and safety decisions are recorded in `docs/workflow-optimization.md`; CI uses one shared validation job and cached npm downloads.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` groups CodeQL action steps so `init` and `analyze` upgrade together (mismatched versions fail analysis).
- `README.md` — project overview.
- `SETUP.md` — fork and signing setup walkthrough.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md` — community files (contribution guide, vulnerability disclosure).
- `docs/configuration.md` — `config.json` field reference and "adding a new app" procedure.
- `docs/architecture.md` — pipeline architecture, job graph, Mermaid diagram.
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` — common failures, symptoms, causes, fixes.
- `docs/release-process.md` — release tagging, naming, and pruning.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` — bug report, app request, download-resolver-failure templates + `config.yml`.
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` — PR description template.
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` — required reviewers per path.

## Generated and Managed Files

The repo mixes hand-curated and workflow-generated content. Treat the categories below as a contract — do not move a file across categories without a PR that explains why.

**User-managed** (edit freely; preserved across workflow runs):

- `config.json` — the source of truth for `patch_repos`, `cli`, `preferred_arch`, `auto_update_urls`.
- `patches.json` — the Boolean values you set per patch. New upstream patches use explicit structured `default` Booleans when present, else `use` (otherwise `true`); MPP-derived metadata uses upstream enabled defaults. Your existing toggles are preserved.
- `docs/`, `README.md`, `SETUP.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `AGENTS.md` — human-authored documentation.
- Tests and fixtures under `.github/scripts/__tests__/`.

**Workflow-managed** (do not hand-edit; the workflow rewrites them):

- `patches.json` keys for newly discovered upstream patches (added by `update-patches.yml`; your existing values are preserved on every sync).
- `config.json` `download_urls` cache — written by `pre_download_apks.sh` when `auto_update_urls` is `true`. Clear `~/.cache/auto-morphe-builder/urls/` to force re-resolution.
- Build artifacts under `apps/`, `tools/`, `out/` — gitignored, produced by the workflow.
- `tree -a -I '.git|node_modules|coverage|dist|build|tools|apps' -L 3` shows the full tree.

**Rule:** when updating `patches.json`, preserve existing user-selected Boolean values; new upstream patches use an explicit upstream `default` Boolean for structured metadata, else an explicit `use` Boolean (otherwise `true`), or their upstream enabled status for MPP-derived metadata. Explicit null compatibility is universal; missing compatibility is malformed. Raw structured metadata may repeat patch names across package declarations and use explicit null target versions for unrestricted compatibility.

## Repository Layout (conceptual)

- **Workflows**: `.github/workflows/morphe-build.yml`, `update-patches.yml`, `ci.yml`, `codeql.yml` — orchestration only.
- **Scripts (Node.js)**: `.github/scripts/*.js` — downloaders, validators, release helpers, installer scripts.
- **Scripts (shell pipeline)**: `.github/scripts/pipeline/*.sh` plus shared helpers in `.github/scripts/pipeline/lib/`. Each `<step>.sh` corresponds to one workflow step.
- **Scripts (CLI orchestrators)**: `scripts/*.js` — thin entry points that wire `node_modules` (ajv etc.) into the pure logic in `.github/scripts/`. `scripts/generate-readme-tables.js` regenerates the "Tested apps" / "Releases & Obtainium" tables in `README.md` from `config.json` `patch_repos`.
- **Tests**: `.github/scripts/__tests__/*.test.js` — Jest unit tests for pure helpers and CLI wrappers.
- **Config**: `config.json`, `patches.json`, `eslint.config.js` (lints `.github/scripts/`, `src/` and `scripts/`).
- **Docs**: `docs/{configuration,architecture,troubleshooting,release-process}.md` plus `README.md`, `SETUP.md`, `AGENTS.md`.
- **Community**: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`.

## Change Rules

1. Keep workflow YAML focused on orchestration; move logic into `.github/scripts/*.js` or `.github/scripts/pipeline/*.sh`.
2. Put reusable logic in JavaScript or shell modules — never inline duplicated shell in workflow YAML.
3. Add or update tests for every behavioural change. Behavioural logic must live behind a pure, exported function so Jest can exercise it without shelling out.
4. Add fixtures (sample `patches-list.json`, APKMirror HTML, protobuf payloads) when handling a new upstream response format.
5. Do not log secrets, passwords, keystore contents, or `Authorization:` headers. Use `set +x` / `::add-mask::` / `keytool -storepass:env` as appropriate.
6. Do not weaken APK, package-name, version, checksum, or signature validation. Adding a "skip the version check" or "trust any cert" path is a hard fail.
7. Preserve backward compatibility for existing `config.json` files unless a breaking change is explicitly documented in the PR description and `docs/configuration.md`.
8. Update related documentation in the same PR. Adding a workflow step, env var, or config field without updating `docs/` and `AGENTS.md` is incomplete.
9. Run all required validation commands before committing (see [Next](#required-validation)).

## Required Validation

Run these before every commit. `npm run check` runs the full chain (lint + test + validate:config + validate:agent-docs + check:readme).

```bash
npm ci
npm run lint
npm test
npm run validate:config
npm run check:readme        # regenerates README tables in-memory and diffs; --check-style
```

`npm run generate:readme` (no flag) writes the regenerated tables back to `README.md` — run this after any change to `config.json` `patch_repos` so the "Tested apps" / "Releases & Obtainium" tables stay in sync. `update-patches.yml` does this automatically on push to main, alongside the existing patches.json sync.

Shell scripts use `shellcheck -x -P SCRIPTDIR .github/scripts/pipeline/*.sh .github/scripts/pipeline/lib/*.sh scripts/*.sh`; workflow YAML uses `actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml`. CI runs `npm run check`, including the `scripts/validate-config.js` entry point (`npm run validate:config`); it catches schema and semantic errors before merge.

## Repo quirks (not obvious from filenames)

- **`morphe-build.yml` runs against the default branch on its `schedule` trigger.** The daily `cron` (05:15 UTC) executes against whichever branch GitHub considers default — currently `main`. A change merged only to `dev` will NOT be picked up by the schedule; it is invisible until `dev` is fast-forwarded or merged into `main`. When a hotfix lands on `dev`, merge it into `main` (or open a `dev` → `main` PR) so the next scheduled build sees it. `workflow_dispatch` lets you pick the ref explicitly, so it can serve as a manual backstop for testing without waiting for the merge.
- Patch metadata is resolved by `.github/scripts/patch-metadata.js`: exact tagged raw `patches-list.json`, then the same release's asset, then metadata derived from the exact digest-verified MPP using the configured, resolved, digest-verified CLI. Names-only lists and absent compatibility trigger fallback; malformed JSON/schema and HTTP/auth/transport errors fail distinctly. Only HTTP 404 means absence; never substitute latest. Release assets use the REST asset endpoint, then the public download URL if that route fails; malformed content does not switch routes and failure of both stops resolution. The first preflight explicitly defers MPP fallback. **Validate deferred patch metadata** runs immediately after `download_morphe_tools.sh`, before the compatibility probe, release filter or APK downloads. Per-matrix fetch and standalone sync share the resolver; sync requires Java 21 and resolves `CLI_TAG` from configuration, downloading fallback tools only when necessary. Failed sync preserves existing choices.
- Generated metadata uses the intersection of versions supported by the actual selected patches (explicit choices plus upstream defaults), with full version tokens such as `12.40.1-prod.01`. Derivation uses `list-patches -p -v --with-descriptions=false`, omitting unused descriptions/options. Universal patches apply to every package; optional version-code rows are validated without changing version tokens. Unrestricted versions are explicit and do not constrain that intersection; an entirely unrestricted selection needs `pin_version`. Experimental targets are excluded. The CLI's no-version display can also mean experimental-only: an additional `-x` listing disambiguates it without accepting those versions. `patch_apk.sh` passes `-e` for explicit generated-metadata opt-ins and `-d` for disabled patches; legacy structured sources retain their existing execution defaults so historical all-true sync entries do not activate diagnostics. Generated selections and version choices must agree across probe, matrix, predownload and target resolution.
- Metadata request/result caches are scoped to one invocation and exact repo/tag/CLI/path identity. Verified fallback binaries live in content-addressed `tools/metadata-artifacts/`; writes are atomic, cached bytes are rechecked, and CLI execution uses a disposable JAR-adjacent data directory with a 60-second deadline. Generated metadata is rebuilt rather than restored from disk cache. Never upload that execution state or treat partial output as metadata. The sanitized real Piko/CLI fixture under `.github/scripts/__tests__/fixtures/patch-metadata/` records its provenance in its README.
- `morphe-desktop.jar` is **never** cached. `actions/cache@v5` only saves on miss, so caching the jar would silently put a stale jar back into `tools/`. `download_morphe_tools.sh` and `fetch_morphe_tools.sh` both `rm -f` and re-download on every run. See `docs/troubleshooting.md` → "java.lang.NoSuchMethodError" for the failure mode this prevents.
- `morphe-desktop.jar` has two layers of integrity checks, in order:
  1. `unzip -p META-INF/MANIFEST.MF | grep Implementation-Version` — strips a trailing `\r` before comparing against `CLI_TAG`, because the upstream JAR's MANIFEST.MF uses CRLF endings and would otherwise warn "version mismatch" even when both sides match.
  2. SHA-256 against the GitHub release-API per-asset digest (`gh_asset_sha256`). A byte-level mismatch against the API digest is a hard fail (corruption or republish).
  3. If the pin row in `checksums/tools.sha256` (with a `# vX.Y.Z` version annotation) names a *different* CLI tag than the one we're downloading, the SHA disagreement is a CLI bump, not a tamper signal — the verify scripts log a `TODO(refresh-pin-morphe-desktop)` line and continue. Without the version annotation, any disagreement stays a hard fail so a malformed manifest cannot silently disable the tripwire.
  See `docs/checksums.md` for the full contract.
- Per-repo `*.mpp` patches archives ARE SHA-256-verified in `fetch_morphe_tools.sh` against the per-asset digest served by the GitHub release API (`gh_asset_sha256`). A stale cache entry (e.g. one left over from before fd537df removed `restore-keys: morphe-patches-<slug>-`) fails the SHA check, gets re-downloaded, and the next `actions/cache` save replaces it with the correct bytes — no manual `gh cache delete` required. See `docs/troubleshooting.md` → "Build job silently skips patches" for the symptom and recovery.
- **A `patch_repos[*].repo` value may carry a forge prefix.** A bare `owner/repo` is GitHub, unchanged; `gitlab:owner/project` is a top-level gitlab.com project. `.github/scripts/patch-source.js` (`parsePatchSource`, pure, unit-tested in `__tests__/patch-source.test.js`) is the only place that interprets it, so `patches.json` keys, `patchSlug`, caches, README tables and `detect-new-repos.js` keep seeing one opaque identity. GitLab bundles resolve through the **generic package registry**, not releases, because `file_sha256` there is the only gitlab.com per-asset digest — release assets are bare links with no digest, so there is no safe release route. That digest is enforced exactly as `gh_asset_sha256` is; a missing or ambiguous digest fails the build. Metadata keeps the GitHub shape: tagged raw `patches-list.json`, then the digest-verified MPP (the intermediate release-asset step has no GitLab equivalent). Subgroup paths, self-hosted instances and any other forge are rejected with a message rather than partly supported. `cli.repo` stays GitHub-only. `.github/scripts/patch-source-runtime.js` is the shell-facing CLI (`host` / `tag` / `mpp`) used by `resolve-tag.sh`, `download_morphe_tools.sh` and `fetch_morphe_tools.sh`. An optional `GITLAB_TOKEN` is sent as `PRIVATE-TOKEN` to gitlab.com only, never logged; gitlab.com's unauthenticated API rate limits are tight enough to 429 a build. See `docs/configuration.md` → “GitLab patch sources”.
- `apkeep` installer verifies SHA-256; `aapt` and `playwright` installers do not (PR 6). The previous `install_bouncycastle.sh` (BouncyCastle for keystore conversion) was deleted when morphe-desktop's `patch --keystore` flags made the conversion redundant.
- `verifyUrl()` in `.github/scripts/unified-downloader.js` (the cache-URL HEAD probe) sanitises the URL through `new URL()` and requires `protocol === 'https:'` before issuing the HEAD request. The URL that reaches `fetch()` is the WHATWG-canonicalised form, not the raw input. The cache file itself is written only by `saveCachedUrl()` after a successful resolver round-trip (or by `update-download-urls.js` from the user's own `patches.json`), so the URL string flowing into `fetch()` is operationally trusted — but the file → fetch edge is real taint and the protocol gate breaks the flow that CodeQL's `js/file-access-to-http` query tracks (alert #37). Tests in `__tests__/unified-downloader-timers.test.js` cover the four cases: http://, file://, malformed, and the canonical https: accept path.
- Direct APK transfers in `downloadWithUrl()` parse and require credential-free HTTPS URLs before invoking curl, terminate curl options with `--`, and restrict redirects to HTTPS. See `docs/checksums.md` for the URL policy and fixture-test isolation.
- Patching and signing are separate jobs. `build` runs `morphe-desktop patch --unsigned` with no signing secrets because patch bundles are third-party code; `create-release` signs with `sign_apks.sh`. Keep them in separate jobs: a process left running by a patch would survive into a later step of the same job. An unsigned APK must never be published, so any signing failure stops the job.

- The downloader saves XAPK/APKM/APKS bundles with a `.apk` extension. `detectApkShape` in `apk-selection.js` inspects zip contents to recognise bundles — required because APKMirror often serves bundles without preserving the extension.
- The `aapt` version check is skipped for split packages (the outer zip-of-zips is not a valid APK); the post-merge step verifies the inner `base.apk`.
- The APKEditor merge keeps the bundle's `META-INF` — `apkeditorMergeArgs` (`src/download/merge-args.js`) is the single place the argv is built, and it must not grow a `-clean-meta`. That flag deletes the directory before the APK is re-emitted, and patches that read the original APK's metadata then fail on every bundle-sourced app: `SigningDataPatch` (AliExpress) aborts with "Expected one AliExpress signing certificate entry", `BypassSignatureCheckPatch` (`iiec`) with "META-INF not found in the input APK". Keeping it ships nothing stale, because `apksigner` replaces the v1 signature files when `create-release` signs the patched APK. See `docs/troubleshooting.md` → "A patch fails on the input APK's `META-INF`".
- `pre_download_apks.sh` runs apps in parallel via `&` + `wait`. Each app's `.mpp` is passed directly to `morphe-desktop list-versions` (no shared-file race).
- After validated local APK reuse, optional goopdl runs before URL caches and the existing providers. Exact stock ARM64 mappings are a fast path; unmapped versions use exact-release/architecture metadata discovery (APKMirror, then APKPure's ARM64 listing) or the explicit requested version name. A discovered code is only a hint: if Play can't deliver it, goopdl retries by the exact version name with the same checks. Never request implicit latest or weaken package/version/ABI/integrity validation. Never upload/cache the private `tools/goopdl-home/` or publish authentication logs or signed delivery URLs. See `docs/architecture.md` → "Google Play first".
- APK `versionName` checks go through `versionMatches` (`src/download/version-match.js`): an exact match, or the version followed by `-`/space and a label (Gboard `-release-arm64-v8a`, Discord ` - Stable`). The number must match in full and pre-release labels (beta, rc, dev...) still fail. Don't loosen it further.
- Original APKs are checked against the developer's signing-certificate SHA-256 in `.github/scripts/apk-signers.json` before merge/patch (`src/download/signer.js`). In a bundle, every APK that gets merged (base and every split) must be signed by a listed key. Never fall back to accepting a wrong signer; only this builder's own unsigned cached merge gets a re-check of its bundle. A missing or broken signers file must fail, not disable the check. See `docs/troubleshooting.md` → "Signature check failed".
- APKMirror uses full Chromium with a matching Chrome user-agent and a warmed context shared through download. Main-frame document responses track automatic challenge recovery; title text alone never overrides an HTTP error. Challenge/status checks and at most one retry report persistent Cloudflare blocks; access from every runner IP is not guaranteed. Keep other providers available.
- APKMirror browser navigation and curl HTML requests share `.github/scripts/apkmirror-pacing.js`: Linux `flock`, 1.5-second spacing after each operation, a 45-second lock acquisition bound, and shared HTTP 429 cooldown (Retry-After seconds/date honored without sleeping or shortening server delays, invalid/missing 30 seconds). Active cooldown fails without requesting the origin. `pre_download_apks.sh` exports a fresh `APKMIRROR_PACING_DIR` to its children and removes it on exit; standalone callers default to runner/temp state keyed by workspace. State contains timestamps only. Coordination is on one runner, never across runners; other providers stay parallel.
- `check_existing_releases.sh` is **fail-open**: if `morphe-desktop list-versions` returns nothing or `gh release view` errors, the app is kept in the matrix with a `::warning::`. The build never silently skips an app we couldn't version-check.
- The `compat-probe` step (in the `check-versions` job) runs `list-versions` per app and surfaces `NoSuchMethodError` / `NoClassDefFoundError` at the cheapest step rather than 30 minutes into the matrix.
- `update-patches.yml`'s push-trigger gate (`scripts/detect-new-repos.js`) opens on **either** a brand-new patch repo in `config.json` (case a) **or** an existing app whose `patch_repos[*].repo` changed (case b — relocated). Case (b) is the bit that catches "I moved sofascore to a different patches repo" — without it, the sync was silently skipped because the destination repo already existed in `patches.json` (carrying unrelated apps), and on the next dispatch the jq merge would have wiped the user's per-patch toggles for the moved app. Both `detectChanges` (`scripts/detect-new-repos.js`) and the merge used by `sync-patches.sh` (`scripts/merge-patches.js`) are pure functions with unit tests in `.github/scripts/__tests__/{detect-new-repos,merge-patches}.test.js`. The merge prefers the destination repo's section for an app but **falls back** to the same app's entry under any other repo key in `patches.json` so explicit `false` toggles like `Disable telemetry: false` survive a repo move.
- The Playwright cache (`~/.cache/ms-playwright`) is restored by `actions/cache` keyed on `runner.os` + hash(`package.json`, `package-lock.json`); when Playwright is upgraded, the primary key misses and the `restore-keys:` prefix fallback brings back an older partial archive that may match one browser (e.g. `chromium-1208`) without matching another (e.g. `chromium_headless_shell-1234`). The previous `find -name 'chrome'` heuristic in `install_playwright.sh` incorrectly reported "all installed" in that case, the install was skipped, the smoke test failed, and **mimo** was the only app that surfaced as a hard failure (every other app's APK download happens to succeed without Playwright). `scripts/check-playwright-browsers.js` (`checkPlaywrightBrowsers`, unit-tested in `.github/scripts/__tests__/check-playwright-browsers.test.js`) is the revision-aware check: it reads `playwright-core/browsers.json` and verifies `INSTALLATION_COMPLETE` at `<cacheDir>/<browser-name-with-underscores>-<expected-revision>/` for each browser. `install_playwright.sh` always runs `install-playwright-browsers.js` regardless of the helper's verdict — the per-browser marker check inside `install-playwright-browsers.js` makes the no-op case free, and unconditionally running it is the only safe posture against stale restore-keys hits.

## Local environment

Node.js 24 (`package.json` requires `>=24`) and Java 21 match the workflow runtimes; action references are full-SHA-pinned with version comments. CI installs `zip` for APK fixtures so those tests do not silently skip. Tests use Jest; ESLint covers `.github/scripts/`, `src/` and `scripts/`. ShellCheck and actionlint run separately from `npm run check`.
